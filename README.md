# CodeChallenge4Quiz


## Description

Take a look at the code quiz I created. This was by far the most difficult challenge in the program. It presented several challenges working in javascript. I gained knowledge in understanding arrays, objects, and functions and manipulating the DOM but I also became stuck on several requirments to create logic to manipuate data. In the future, I plan to revisit and generate the local storage to save user scores and further develop the project.
